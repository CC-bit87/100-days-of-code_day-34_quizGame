# 100-days-of-code_day-34_quizGame
The code forms the basis of an interactive quiz game with visual effects, sound, and user interaction. It leverages various libraries and concepts to create an engaging experience for the user.


1. **Initialization**: The program sets up a graphical user interface (GUI) using the `customtkinter` library, and a quiz is initialized with given questions and answers (from the `QuizBrain` class, not shown in the code).

2. **GUI Layout**: The main window of the application is created with a specific geometry, title, and theme color. The window includes labels for displaying the score and question, images for faces and buttons, and buttons for user input.

3. **Music Playback**: If pygame is integrated (as discussed in previous messages), the program will play background music with a fade-in effect when the application starts.

4. **Question Display**: Questions are displayed within a specific label, and the text is wrapped to fit the label using the `wrap_text` method.

5. **User Interaction**: The user can answer questions by clicking the true or false buttons. The buttons are associated with specific images, and their behavior is defined in the `button_click_check` and `button_click_x` methods.

6. **Feedback**: When the user answers a question, the program provides visual feedback by temporarily changing the background color of the question label to green (for correct answers) or red (for incorrect answers). The original image is then restored after a short delay.

7. **Next Question**: The program continues to present questions from the quiz until it's finished. It appears that the code for ending the quiz or showing the final score is not included in the provided snippets, so further implementation might be needed for that functionality.
